# AskAdmin - Banned Mail List (your e-mail on their black list)

A word of explanation:
if you will decide to pay for AskAdmin program, and then you will stop doing it - your e-mail address will be added to the mentioned list in the title. Or, if they will thinks that you selling your own copy of the AskAdmin program - your e-mail will be added there too!

You have to place this program in the extracted AskAdmin location, where the "AskAdmin.exe" and/or "AskAdmin_x64.exe" exists.
This simple program executes the "AskAdmin.exe" or "AskAdmin_x64.exe" (with special/hidden command-line parameter prepared by AskAdmin owners) depends of your OS architecture.

After successfully execution you will see all e-mails banned by the AskAdmin owners:

So please report them to the police or to the relevant authorities in your country if you find your email address on their list, because otherwise they will never understand that they are doing something wrong that they shouldn't be doing at all (and they won't stop attacking me)....

Possible messages on executing:
1. Can't find AskAdmin.exe in the current location ("X:\\(...)")...

If you want to have your own full version of AskAdmin without any restrictions, I will suggest to download it from there:
https://diakov.net/14275-askadmin-v18.html
instead of pay for it for people who won't understand that they doing wrong (and they are angry at me)...
I can admit that the above link does not contain latest version of AskAdmin, but it's the full version without any restrictions!

If someone will decide to create a class action, please also include the message wrote by the AskAmin owners from there:
